# Updated-Portfolio
## About 
This project contains my new and improved web page. The content is based loosely off of
the first portfolio I made. It contains information about myself, some examples of projects I've made as well as a contact section with links to some of my pages. This new web page is more aesthetically pleasing and has greater functionality as there is now mobile responsiveness.

## Things I'd like to add/change:
* Make the contact form actually function
* Imporve on the parallax style as it is a very basic implementation
* Create a nicer way of displaying my projects
* Improve the contact form
